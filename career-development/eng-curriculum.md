# Software Engineer Curriculum

## What Is This

Would you like to improve your skills as an Software Engineer, but don't know where to start ? There are tons of resources on the Internet, and it's easy to get lost. Here we attempt to maintain a curated list of verified and proven articles, books and videos about various engineering topics. It's by no means a comprehensive course, just some guidance.

## How To Use

1. Use [Software Engineering Career Ladder](https://wiki.fitbit.com/display/IPD/Software+Engineering+Career+Ladder) to identify areas of improvement with your manager.
2. Depending on how you prefer to learn, pick an article, a book or a video from the section you're interested in. 
3. Follow links and references, explore related topics.
4. Think about what resonates with you or what you disagree with. 
5. Discuss with colleagues or with your manager on the next 1-on-1.
6. Give it a try! Practice makes perfect.

Note: some "dead tree" books can be found on the [Minsk office bookshelf](https://wiki.fitbit.com/display/intranet/Minsk+Bookshelf>).
